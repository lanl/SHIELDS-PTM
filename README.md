### About the code
This directory contains the simulation code and analysis tools for the SHIELDS particle tracing model (PTM).

The main source is written in Fortran2008. Associated scripts, pre-processing, and post-processing are written in Python 3.

To build PTM, simply run:
```
make
```

To build the fortran only run `make ptm`, to build/install the Python module only run `make python`, and to convert the Markdown documents to PDF use `make docs`.
The documentation conversion uses the Node.js `mdpdf` module, which can be installed using `npm install mdpdf -g`. PDF documentation is placed in the `docs` directory.

### RKSUITE
In addition to the basic RK4 integrator, SHIELDS-PTM provides an interface to the RKSUITE library allowing users to select higher-order, adaptive integrators.
If these integrators are used, RKSUITE and its originators should be credited. For details, please see [rksuite_readme](src/rksuite_readme).
